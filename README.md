# rock-paper-scissors-game
this project is a simple yet fun Rock, Paper, Scissors Game where you can play against the computer! 🤖

🔹 How it works:
The game uses JavaScript to generate a random choice for the computer, and you get to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking on one of the three buttons. The game then compares your choice to the computer's, and the winner is displayed! 🏆
 
This project helped me understand JavaScript basics, random functions, and DOM manipulation.
